### EC2 notes

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

### S3 notes

Amazon S3 is a repository for Internet data. Amazon S3 provides access to reliable, fast, and inexpensive data storage infrastructure. It is designed to make web-scale computing easy by enabling you to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from within Amazon EC2 or anywhere on the web

### CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.

### Lambda

AWS Lambda is an event-driven computing cloud service from Amazon Web Services that allows developers to program functions on a pay-per-use basis without having to provision storage or compute resources to support them.

### Cloudwatch

Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. ... CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define.

### ELB

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. It enables you to achieve fault tolerance in your applications, seamlessly providing the required amount of load balancing capacity needed to route application traffic.

### Terraform by HashiCorp

“infrastructure as code” tool similar to AWS CloudFormation that allows you to create, update, and version your Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. Part of the DevOps Partner Solutions.
