# AWS vpn essentials

The VPN connection has two parallel routes (IPsec tunnels), which is for redundancy.
Only one Virtual Private Gateway can be attached to a VPC (just like only one IGW can be attached to a VPC).
A VPC can have both a VPG and an IGW attached at the same time.

# Customer Gateways:
A Customer Gateway is a physical device or software application at the on-premise location that acts as the "connector" to the VPN connection.
In your AWS account, the Customer Gateway component is where you configure the public IP address of the physical device or software application at the on-premise location
Both a VPG and a Customer Gateway are required to establish a VPN connection.

# VPN Connection:
The VPN connection is the actual link between the virtual private gateway and the customer Gateway
Each connection uses two IPsec tunnels for redundancy

# Virtual Private Gateway
A virtual private Gateway acts as the "connector" on the VPC (AWS) side of the VPN connection
The VPG is connected to the VPC

# Router
When setting up a VPN the route table (for the subnet you wish to extend) must include routes for the on-premise network that are used by the VPN, and point them to the Virtual Private Gateway

# Direct Connect Essentials:
AWS Direct Connect is a service that provides a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.
Does not require hosting any router/hardware at the Direct Connect Partner location, only requires a Direct Connect location and a participating backbone provider.
An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to the AWS region it is associated with.
It does not provide access to other AWS regions.
    # Reduce network costs:
    Reduce bandwidth commitment to corporate ISP over public internet
    Data transferred over direct connect is billed at a lower rate by Amazon (data in/out)

    # Increase network consistency
    Dedicated private connections reduce latency (over sending the traffic via public routing)

    # Dedicated private network connection to on-premise
    Connect the direct connect connection to a VGW in your VPC for a dedicated private connection from on-premise to VPC.
    Use Multiple VIF (Virtual Interfaces) to connect to multiple VPCs.

# Storage Gateway Essentials
Storage Gateway connects local data center software appliances to cloud based storage such as Amazon S3.
It does this though the Storage Gateway virtual appliance, which connects directly to your local infrastructure as a file server, a local disk volume, or as a virtual tape library (VTL).
It can maintain frequently accessed data on-premises (providing low-latency performance) while storing all other data in:
    S3
    EBS 
    Glacier
Storage Gateway also integrates your data with:
    AWS encryption
    Identity management
    Monitoring
    
# Gateway-Cached Volumes
Create storage volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices on the on-premise servers.
The gateway will store the data written to this volume in Amazon S3 and will cache frequently access data on-premise in the storage device

# Gateway-Stored Volumes
Store all the data locally (on-premise) in storage volumes.
Gateway will periodically take snapshots of the data as incremental backups and stores them on Amazon S3
